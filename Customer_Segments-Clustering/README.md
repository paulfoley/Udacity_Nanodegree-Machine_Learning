# Project - Creating Customer Segments

Many companies today collect vast amounts of data on customers and clientele, and have a strong desire to understand the meaningful relationships hidden in their customer base. Knowing this information can assist the company in engineering future products and services that best satisfy the demands or needs of their customers.

A wholesale distributor recently tested a change to their delivery method for some customers, by moving from a morning delivery service five days a week to a cheaper evening delivery service three days a week. Initial testing did not discover any significant unsatisfactory results, so they implemented the cheaper option for all customers. Almost immediately, the distributor began getting complaints about the delivery service change and customers were canceling deliveries, losing the distributor more money than what was being saved. You've been hired by the wholesale distributor to find what types of customers they have to help them make better, more informed business decisions in the future. Your task is to use unsupervised learning techniques to see if any similarities exist between customers, and how to best segment customers into distinct categories.

## Project Overview

In this project we will apply unsupervised learning techniques, using the [scikit-learn](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/scikit-learn) library, on product spending data collected for customers of a wholesale distributor in Lisbon, Portugal to identify customer segments hidden in the data. 

### Project Steps

* Explore the data by selecting a small subset to sample.
* Determine if any product categories highly correlate with one another. 
* Preprocess the data by scaling each product category
* Identify (and remove) unwanted outliers. 
* Apply PCA transformations to the data.
* Implement clustering algorithms to segment the transformed customer data.
* Interpret data points that have been scaled, transformed, or reduced from PCA.
* Compare the segmentation found with an additional labeling.
* Consider ways this information could assist the wholesale distributor with future service changes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need to install:

* [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
* [Python (Minimum 3)](https://www.continuum.io/blog/developer-blog/python-3-support-anaconda)
* [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)
* [Pandas](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/pandas)
* [Numpy](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/numpy)
* [scikit-learn](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/scikit-learn)
* [Matplotlib](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/matplotlib)

### Data Files

* `customers.csv` - The customer segments data is included as a selection of 440 data points collected on data found from clients of a wholesale distributor in Lisbon, Portugal. More information can be found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers).

#### Features

* `Fresh` - Annual spending (m.u.) on fresh products (Continuous)
* `Milk` - Annual spending (m.u.) on milk products (Continuous)
* `Grocery` - Annual spending (m.u.) on grocery products (Continuous)
* `Frozen` - Annual spending (m.u.) on frozen products (Continuous)
* `Detergents_Paper` - Annual spending (m.u.) on detergents and paper products (Continuous)
* `Delicatessen` - Annual spending (m.u.) on and delicatessen products (Continuous)
* `Channel` - {Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe - 1, Retail - 2} (Nominal)
* `Region` - {Lisbon - 1, Oporto - 2, or Other - 3} (Nominal) 

Note (m.u.) is shorthand for *monetary units*.


## Python Notebook and Scripts

* `Customer_Segments.ipynb` - Main project file, an IPython Notebook that contains the analysis for the project.
* `visuals.py` - A Python script containing visualization code that is run behind the scenes.

### Opening the Jupyter Notebook

The project `Customer_Segments.ipynb` can be read using a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html). There's also an HTML version `Customer_Segments.html` included for easier viewability.

* Open your Command Prompt (PC) or terminal (Mac or Linux).
* On a PC click the Start button and search for "Command Prompt".
* On a Mac type command + spacebar. Then, type "terminal" in the Spotlight Search. You can also search for "terminal" in finder.
* Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the Jupyter notebook file.
* On a PC you might type: cd C:\Users\username\Downloads\, replacing your username.
* On Mac or Linux you might type: cd ~/Downloads.
* Run the command `jupyter notebook Customer_Segments.ipynb` in your terminal.

This will open the [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) in your browser.

#### Special Note

If you try running a code block and get an error message like `no module named matplotlib`, then your distribution of [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) may be missing a package used in the project. That's okay â€“ there's an easy way that you can install these packages. It's as simple as [Googling](https://www.google.com/) the library for easy to use guides on installation!
