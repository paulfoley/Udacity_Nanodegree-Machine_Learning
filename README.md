# Udacity Nanodegree - Machine Learning

The [Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009) is built with leading technology companies, such as [Google](https://www.google.com/) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) to ensure mastery of the exact skills necessary to build a career in machine learning.


## Nanodegree Overview

Machine learning represents a key evolution in the fields of computer science, data analysis, software engineering, and artificial intelligence. Machine learning is literally everywhere, and is often at work even when we don’t realize it. [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/), [Siri](https://www.apple.com/ios/siri/), and [Facebook News Feeds](https://www.facebook.com/) are just a few popular examples of machine learning’s omnipresence. The ability to develop machines and systems that automatically improve, puts machine learning at the absolute forefront of virtually any field that relies on data.
