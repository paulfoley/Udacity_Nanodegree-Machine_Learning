# Project - Detect SMS Spam

Spam detection is one of the major applications of Machine Learning in the interwebs today. Pretty much all of the major email service providers have spam detection systems built in and automatically classify such mail as 'Junk Mail'. 

In this mission we will be using the Naive Bayes algorithm to create a model that can classify [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection) SMS messages as spam or not spam, based on the training we give to the model. It is important to have some level of intuition as to what a spammy text message might look like. Usually they have words like 'free', 'win', 'winner', 'cash', 'prize' and the like in them as these texts are designed to catch your eye and in some sense tempt you to open them. Also, spam messages tend to have words written in all capitals and also tend to use a lot of exclamation marks. To the recipient, it is usually pretty straightforward to identify a spam text and our objective here is to train a model to do that for us!

Being able to identify spam messages is a binary classification problem as messages are classified as either 'Spam' or 'Not Spam' and nothing else. Also, this is a supervised learning problem, as we will be feeding a labelled dataset into the model, that it can learn from, to make future predictions. 

## Project Overview

In this project we will apply unsupervised learning techniques, using the [scikit-learn](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/scikit-learn) library, on [product spending data of the wholesale distributor provided by UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers). We'll look for similarities that exist between customers, and how to best segment customers into distinct categories. Our end goal is to identify customer segments hidden in the data. 

### Project Steps

* Explore the data by selecting a small subset to sample.
* Determine if any product categories highly correlate with one another. 
* Preprocess the data by scaling each product category.
* Identify (and remove) unwanted outliers. 
* Apply PCA transformations to the data.
* Implement clustering algorithms to segment the transformed customer data.
* Interpret data points that have been scaled, transformed, or reduced from PCA.
* Compare the segmentation found with an additional labeling.
* Consider ways this information could assist the wholesale distributor with future service changes.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need to install:

* [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
* [Python (Minimum 3)](https://www.continuum.io/blog/developer-blog/python-3-support-anaconda)
* [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)
* [Pandas](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/pandas)
* [Numpy](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/numpy)
* [scikit-learn](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/scikit-learn)
* [Matplotlib](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/matplotlib)

### Data Files

* `customers.csv` - The customer segments data is included as a selection of 440 data points collected on data found from clients of a wholesale distributor in Lisbon, Portugal. More information can be found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers).

#### Features

* `Fresh` - Annual spending (m.u.) on fresh products (Continuous)
* `Milk` - Annual spending (m.u.) on milk products (Continuous)
* `Grocery` - Annual spending (m.u.) on grocery products (Continuous)
* `Frozen` - Annual spending (m.u.) on frozen products (Continuous)
* `Detergents_Paper` - Annual spending (m.u.) on detergents and paper products (Continuous)
* `Delicatessen` - Annual spending (m.u.) on and delicatessen products (Continuous)
* `Channel` - {Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe - 1, Retail - 2} (Nominal)
* `Region` - {Lisbon - 1, Oporto - 2, or Other - 3} (Nominal) 

Note - *(m.u.)* is shorthand for *monetary units*.


## Python Notebook and Scripts

* `Customer_Segments.ipynb` - Main project file, an IPython Notebook that contains the analysis for the project.
* `visuals.py` - A Python script containing visualization code that is run behind the scenes.

### Opening the Jupyter Notebook

The project `Customer_Segments.ipynb` can be read using a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html). There's also an HTML version `Customer_Segments.html` included for easier viewability.

* Open your Command Prompt (PC) or terminal (Mac or Linux).
* On a PC click the Start button and search for "Command Prompt".
* On a Mac type command + spacebar. Then, type "terminal" in the Spotlight Search. You can also search for "terminal" in finder.
* Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the Jupyter notebook file.
* On a PC you might type: cd C:\Users\username\Downloads\, replacing your username.
* On Mac or Linux you might type: cd ~/Downloads.
* Run the command `jupyter notebook Customer_Segments.ipynb` in your terminal.

This will open the [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) in your browser.

#### Special Note

If you try running a code block and get an error message like `no module named matplotlib`, then your distribution of [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) may be missing a package used in the project. That's okay â€“ there's an easy way that you can install these packages. It's as simple as [Googling](https://www.google.com/) the library for easy to use guides on installation!
