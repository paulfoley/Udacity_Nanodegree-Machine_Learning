# Project - Finding Donors for CharityML

This project is designed to show off supervised learning algorithms available in [scikit-learn](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/scikit-learn), as well as show a method for evaluating how each model works. It is important in machine learning to understand exactly when and where a certain algorithm should be used, and when one should be avoided.


## Project Overview

In this project, we will apply supervised learning techniques to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. 

### Project Steps

* Explore the data to learn how the census data is recorded. 
* Apply a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. 
* Establish a benchmark for a solution to identifying charity donors.
* Evaluate several supervised learners on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution. 
* Optimize the model and present it as a solution to CharityML. 
* Explore the chosen model and its predictions, to see how well it's performing.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need to install:

* [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
* [Python (Minimum 3)](https://www.continuum.io/blog/developer-blog/python-3-support-anaconda)
* [Pandas](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/pandas)
* [Numpy](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/numpy)
* [scikit-learn](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/scikit-learn)
* [Matplotlib](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/matplotlib)

### Data Files

The modified census dataset consists of approximately 32,000 data points, with each datapoint having 13 features. This dataset is a modified version of the dataset published in the paper [*"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: a Decision-Tree Hybrid",* by Ron Kohavi](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The original dataset hosted on [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).

#### Target Variable

* `income`: Income Class (<=50K, >50K)


## Python Notebook and Scripts

* `Finding_Charity_Donors.ipynb` - Main project file, an IPython Notbook that contains the analysis for the project.

* `visuals.py` - A Python script containing visualization code that is run behind the scenes.

### Opening the Jupyter Notebook

The project `Finding_Charity_Donors.ipynb` can be read using a Jupyter Notebook. There's also an HTML version `Finding_Charity_Donors.html` included for easier viewability.

* Open your Command Prompt (PC) or terminal (Mac or Linux).
* On a PC click the Start button and search for "Command Prompt".
* On a Mac type command + spacebar. Then, type "terminal" in the Spotlight Search. You can also search for "terminal" in finder.
* Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the Jupyter notebook file.
* On a PC you might type: cd C:\Users\username\Downloads\, replacing your username. Learn more about basic terminal commands.
* On Mac or Linux you might type: cd ~/Downloads.
* Run the command `jupyter notebook Finding_Charity_Donors.ipynb` in your terminal.

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

#### Special Note

If you try running a code block and get an error message like 'no module named matplotlib', then your distribution of Anaconda may be missing a package used in the project. That's okay â€“ there's an easy way that you can install these packages. It's as simple as Googling the library for easy to use guides on installation!
